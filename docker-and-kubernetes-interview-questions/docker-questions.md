### Docker Questions

1. **What is Docker and why is it used?**  
   *Hint:* Explain containerization, portability, and consistency across environments.

2. **Difference between containers and virtual machines?**  
   *Hint:* Containers share the host OS kernel, VMs have separate OS instances.

3. **What is a Docker image vs a Docker container?**  
   *Hint:* Image = template; Container = running instance of an image.

4. **What is a Dockerfile?**  
   *Hint:* It's a script containing instructions to build a Docker image.

5. **Explain the difference between `ADD` and `COPY` in Dockerfile.**  
   *Hint:* `COPY` is straightforward; `ADD` can handle remote URLs and extract archives.

6. **What is the purpose of `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in Dockerfile?**  
   *Hint:* Define default execution behavior; `ENTRYPOINT` gives fixed command, `CMD` provides default args.

7. **How do you view the list of running Docker containers?**  
   *Hint:* Use `docker ps`; use `docker ps -a` for all including stopped.

8. **What is a Docker volume and why is it used?**  
   *Hint:* For data persistence across container restarts.

9. **Difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?**  
   *Hint:* `run` creates and executes; `start` restarts an existing stopped container.

10. **What is a multi-stage build in Docker?**  
    *Hint:* Reduce final image size by separating build and runtime stages.


- **How do you debug a failed container in Docker?**  
  *Hint:* Use `docker logs <container_id>` and `docker inspect <container_id>` to view logs and container state.

- **Explain Docker Compose and its benefits.**  
  *Hint:* Compose is used for defining and running multi-container Docker apps using a YAML file.

- **How do you optimize Docker images for production?**  
  *Hint:* Use multi-stage builds, exclude unnecessary files, and use smaller base images like Alpine.

- **How do you persist data generated by Docker containers?**  
  *Hint:* Use Docker volumes or bind mounts to retain data outside the container lifecycle.

- **How would you secure Docker containers in production?**  
  *Hint:* Run as non-root, use minimal base images, and scan images for vulnerabilities.

- **How do you build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub?**  
  *Hint:* Build with `docker build -t username/repo:tag .` and push with `docker push username/repo:tag`.

- **What are health checks and restart policies in Docker?**  
  *Hint:* Health checks define the healthy state of a container. Restart policies control automatic container restarts.
