## Senior Developer Interview Questions on Git

### Concepts \& Fundamentals

- Explain the difference between git fetch, git pull, and git rebase.
- Describe how Git’s three-tree architecture works (working directory, staging area, repository).


### Advanced Workflow/Branching

- How would you design a branching strategy for a large team/project (e.g., Git Flow, trunk-based development)?
- How do you handle merge conflicts in a collaborative environment?
- Can you explain Cherry-picking and when you would use it?


### Internals \& Troubleshooting

- What happens internally when you run git commit?
- How do you recover from a lost commit or branch (e.g., using reflog)?
- How do you revert a faulty merge?


### Collaboration \& Code Review

- What are the best practices for writing useful commit messages?
- How do you manage pull requests and code reviews with Git?


### Performance \& Large Repositories

- How do you handle very large repositories or files in Git (e.g., git-lfs)?
- What strategies can improve performance for monorepos?


### Security \& Audit

- How can you remove sensitive information (like a password) from a repository’s history?


### Scenario-Based/Problem-Solving

- Describe a situation where a teammate force-pushed and overwrote your work. How do you recover?
- How would you resolve a situation where two long-lived branches have heavily diverged?


### Scripting \& Automation

- How can you automate repetitive Git workflows (with hooks or scripts)?
- How would you trigger a CI/CD pipeline based on Git tags?


### Miscellaneous

- In which situations would you prefer squash merging over regular merges?
- Explain the differences between git reset --soft, --mixed, and --hard.
