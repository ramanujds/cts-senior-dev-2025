`useState` and `useReducer` are both React hooks for managing state in functional components, but they are designed for different scenarios:

***

### useState

- **Best for:** Simple, independent state variables (strings, numbers, booleans, small arrays/objects).
- **Usage:** Each call manages one piece of state and provides an updater function.
- **Syntax:**
  ```js
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  ```
- **Pros:** Very simple to set up and read.
- **Cons:** Can become unwieldy if state updates are complex or if there are multiple related pieces of state.[1][4][6]

***

### useReducer

- **Best for:**
    - Complex state with multiple related values.
    - When next state depends on the previous state.
    - Folding intricate update logic, like switching over action types.
- **Usage:** Accepts a reducer function (handles state transitions based on "actions") and an initial state.
- **Syntax:**
  ```js
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  ```
  The `reducer` function shape:
  ```js
  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
      // ...
      default:
        return state;
    }
  }
  ```
  Use it via:
  ```js
  dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
  ```
- **Pros:** Centralizes all state operations, easier to reason about when state manipulations are dependent or have multiple branches.
- **Cons:** More boilerplate, extra abstraction for simple scenarios.[2][5][6][1]

### When to Use Each

| Criteria                            | useState                   | useReducer                |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Simplicity                          | Simple, isolated values    | Complex, interrelated data|
| State Transition Logic               | Basic                      | Needs reducer function    |
| Scale                               | Few state variables        | Many/related variables    |
| Performance/Testing                  | Not optimized/testable     | Pure function, testable   |
| Common Example                      | Counter, input text        | Form state, list editing  |

### Example Comparison

**useState:**
```js
const [stockName, setStockName] = useState('');
const [stockQty, setStockQty] = useState(0);
```
**useReducer:**
```js
function stockReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'updateName':
      return { ...state, name: action.value };
    case 'updateQty':
      return { ...state, qty: action.value };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stockReducer, { name: '', qty: 0 });
// dispatch({ type: 'updateName', value: 'Apple' })
```

- For a form or list with logic-heavy updates, `useReducer` is easier to manage and scale.
- For simple UI flags or fields, `useState` is typically preferred.[5][6][1][2]

***

In summary:
- Use `useState` for straightforward, isolated state.
- Use `useReducer` for complex state or if you need centralized/collaborative state logic.`useState` is the simpler hook, ideal for basic state values and when updates are unrelated or straightforward, while `useReducer` is best for more complex state logic, especially when updates depend on previous state or multiple state variables are closely related.[1][2]

***

### useState

- **Purpose:** Manages simple state values like primitives (string, number, boolean) or independent objects/arrays.
- **Usage:**
  ```js
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  setCount(count + 1);
  ```
- **When to use:**
    - Independent simple state variables
    - State updates that don't depend on previous state
    - Small components[4][6][1]

***

### useReducer

- **Purpose:** Manages complex state, especially when future state depends on current state or for object/array states.
- **Usage:**
  ```js
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  // reducer example:
  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
      default: return state;
    }
  }
  dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
  ```
- **When to use:**
    - Complex state logic (e.g., forms, lists)
    - Multiple interdependent state values
    - State updates that depend on the previous state, or involve many transition types[2][5][1]

### Comparison Table

| Feature      | useState                                  | useReducer                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity   | Simple                                    | Complex, logically related state                   |
| Updates      | Direct value setting                      | Centralized, action-driven via reducer function    |
| Best for     | Single/independent values                 | Multiple/related values, advanced update flows     |
| Example      | Counters, toggles, simple inputs          | Dynamic forms, undo/redo, lists, business logic    |

***

**Summary:**  
Use `useState` for simple, local state and `useReducer` when logic is complex or involves many, related state changes.[6][1][2]
