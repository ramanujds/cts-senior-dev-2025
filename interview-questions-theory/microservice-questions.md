### Core Microservices Concepts
- What are microservices, and how do they differ from monolithic architecture?
- What are the main benefits and challenges of a microservices-based architecture?
- How do you ensure loose coupling in a microservices ecosystem?
- What is the role of service discovery in microservices?
- How do microservices communicate with each other? Which communication styles are commonly used?
- What is the significance of domain-driven design (DDD) in building microservices?
- What kind of data management strategies can be applied in microservices (e.g., database-per-service vs shared database)?
- How do you handle transactions that span multiple microservices?
- How do you ensure fault tolerance and resiliency in microservices?
- Can you explain the concept of API Gateway in microservices architecture?
