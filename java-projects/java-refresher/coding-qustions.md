1. How to reverse string in java?
2. Write a Java 8 program to remove the duplicate elements from the list?
3. Program to print non-repeating character from integer array
4. Given list of integers, sort all values in descending order using stream
5. Program to count occurrence of words in a string using java 8
6. Program to count occurrence of each character in a string
7. Java program - Remove duplicate values(They will share one link)
   Input - 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5
   Output – 5
8. Roman to Integer
9. Array contains multiple duplicate elements and a single unique element. Find and
   return that unique element
10. Find unique number from the list(Input is int array)
11. There is a list of number from 1 to 20 and there are three threads which will print the
    numbers
    Thread-1 will print numbers which are divisible by 3
    Thread-2 will print numbers which are divisible by 5
    Thread-3 will print remaining numbers in the list
    How will you approach this and what if numbers to be printed sequentially as well
    from 1 to 20.
12. There is an array of numbers and given a variable K (let say has value 4)
        Need to find pair of numbers in the list such that when you divide them the remainder
        is equal to K
        Or
        Need to find pair of numbers in the list such the when you sum then you will get the
        sum as K.
13. Need to complete the code for the below ‘check’ function:
    public boolean check(String target, String[] arr) {
              // To-Do
  
}
    check(&quot;abcdef&quot;, [&quot;ab&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;ef&quot;]);  // true
    check(&quot;xabcdef&quot;, [&quot;ab&quot;, &quot;cd&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;de&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, &quot;ef&quot;]); // false
    given array of String and a target string need to find out if the strings in the given
    array concatenates and form the target string. If form then return true else false.
14. Remove duplicate characters in the given string. Below are the constraints needs to
    be followed:
    a. Can’t use any Collection like Set, Map for duplicate character checking
    b. Time complexity should be O(n)
    c. No use of String comparison method
    d. Not take each char and compare it with string or other character
    e. Return value should be string without duplicate characters.
